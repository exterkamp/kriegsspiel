# Case flank-march-woods: A flank march through the northern wood, watched from across the river

**What this case tests.** Red-2 marches west then south into the northern wood to come out on the river west of the bridge. Blue cavalry watches from the south bank 650 m away. Fog-of-war test: a unit in a wood is concealed beyond close range, so Blue should not observe Red-2 at the turn end if it is inside the wood; it may see it at the start in the open. Wood slows the march.

Red's Vanguard Battalion stood in line by the high road at (1950,300) to draw the eye, but it is about 1.4 km from the nearest Blue troops, well beyond their sight. Blue's cavalry squadron received its order at minute 5, moved up to the river bank at (1100,1620) and watched the northern wood. The wood's edge is about 750 m off and the battalion inside it is concealed by the trees and beyond the squadron's 800 m sight in any case, so nothing was seen.

The slow going in the wood used up most of the turn. Red-1 stood on the high road in view of the enemy to hold their attention, but at 1400 m from the Blue infantry no one could see it. Blue-3 watched the wood from the south bank, but at about 840 m from the Red column, and with the column hidden by the trees, it saw nothing. No other units moved and no one saw anyone; no fire or melee. The result matches the projection."
