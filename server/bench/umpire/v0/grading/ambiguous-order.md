# Case ambiguous-order: Vague orders on both sides

**What this case tests.** Blue-1 is told to "take up a good position near the river and deal with them as you see fit"; Red-2 is told only "Push on." A good umpire reads each as its commander plausibly would (a literal-minded colonel takes the obvious position: the bank by the bridge; a by-the-book colonel pushes on along the road), records "partly" or "carried-out" with an account that explains the reading, and does not invent a dramatic outcome.

Red-2 received the order 'Push on', which names no objective, and Col. Hartmann advanced about a kilometre south in column towards the high road, halting short of the river. The other Red units had no orders and held. At the end of the turn the Red column was in sight of the Blue infantry and cavalry, but no fire was exchanged. This differs from the projection only in the movement of red-2."
