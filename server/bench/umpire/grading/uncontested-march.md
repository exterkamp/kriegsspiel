# Case uncontested-march: An uncontested march down the high road

**What this case tests.** Red marches south on the road with no enemy within reach. A good umpire moves the columns about as far as the projection, keeps losses at zero, and has Blue (with no new orders) stay put. Nobody sees anybody across 1 km of open ground beyond sight range.
